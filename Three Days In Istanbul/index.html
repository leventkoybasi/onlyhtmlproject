        <p>
          Istanbul is a magical composition of two continents. And especially
          the Bosphorus, Istanbul Strait will cheer up your hearts. Aside from
          being the largest and most popular city of Turkey, Istanbul is also
          the biggest cultural and financial center of Turkey. Istanbul is
          considered to be the bridge that links Asia with Europe from a
          cultural and geographical standpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Istanbul is located partly in Asia and the other part in Europe. Its
          geographical position as well as its rich history are responsible for
          a fascinating melting pot of cultures. Tourists are flocking to
          experience this magical city full of contrasts for themselves, making
          it the 5th most popular tourist destination in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Istanbul offers an unforgettable experience for its travelers, with
          its colorful daily city life and dynamic nightlife. The beautiful
          silhouette of the city combines historical sites and monuments such as
          Roman aqueducts, Byzantine churches, Venetian towers, Ottoman palaces
          from the Byzantine, Ottoman and Turkish periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the skyline covers monumental minarets with skyscrapers and
          plazas. And especially the

        <p>
          Start early with a hearty breakfast at Van Kahvaltı Evi in Cihangir. A
          traditional Turkish spread includes a selection of salty white
          cheeses, hard-boiled eggs, muhammara (an addictive red
          pepper-and-walnut spread), bal-kaymak (delicious clotted cream with
          honey), and a basket of warm bread that the waiters will keep
          refilling despite your protests. Consider it fuel for the sightseeing
          to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          First stop:
          <a

            class="link"
            ><b><i>Topkapı Palace</i></b></a
          >, a.k.a. the Seraglio, a 15th-century Ottoman palace and municipal
          complex that served as the heart of the empire for 380 years. Royal
          gardens, peeling frescoes, and tiled mosaics are breathtaking in their
          beauty, but the zenith of any visit is a wander through the sultan’s
          harem, once home to hundreds of concubines and their eunuch guards. If
          you’re intrigued by castle drama—The Real Housewives of
          Constantinople, joked one friend—then rent an English-language audio
          guide at the entrance. (To save yourself additional time and money,
          buy an Istanbul Museum Pass before your visit. The five-day tourist
          card charges a flat rate—125 lira or about $30—for access to a dozen
          of the city’s most popular cultural institutions, including

          , a Greek-Orthodox church built by Emperor Justinian circa 537 AD,
          converted into a mosque by Sultan Mehmet II in 1453, and declared a
          museum in 1934 by the republic of Turkey’s founder, Mustafa Kemal
          Atatürk; and the 402-year-old Blue Mosque, which earned its nickname
          thanks to the dreamy Iznik tiles that cover its walls. The latter
          reopened to tourists in May, following a two-month renovation, but it
          remains closed to non-Islamic worshippers during each of the five
          daily calls to prayer. For the best experience, avoid visiting on
          Fridays or within a half hour after the ezan is chanted from the
          minarets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come late afternoon, carve out some time to explore two adjacent
          neighborhoods:
          <a
            href="/HTML Project/P01/img/karakoy.jpg"
            target="_blank"
            class="link"
            ><b><i>Karaköy</i></b></a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="/HTML Project/P01/img/Galata-Tower.jpg"
            target="_blank"
            class="link"
            ><b><i>Galata</i></b></a
          >. The former is a historic harbor district dotted with small
          galleries, cute coffeehouses, gritty street art, and hip boutiques.
          Hit up Bey Karaköy for Everlane-style minimalist menswear and
          cool-girl concept shop Mae Zae for handmade ceramics and funky wood
          and leather jewelry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next neighborhood over is
          <a
            href="/HTML Project/P01/img/Galata-Tower.jpg"
            target="_blank"
            class="link"
            ><b><i>Galata</i></b></a
          >, a Genoese colony back in the Byzantine and Ottoman eras. Twisting
          cobblestone streets give this quarter a charming European air, but
          avoid the overpriced restaurants clustered around the famed Galata
          Tower. Instead, head to Salt Galata, an Ottoman bank turned multi-use
          space: Under one architecturally pleasing roof you’ll find a tightly
          edited bookstore (Robinson Crusoe 389), communal café, and research
          library stuffed with books about art, graphic design, and Turkish
          culture. The shopping continues along design-forward Serdar-ı Ekrem
          street; look for kilim throw pillows and olive-wood serving trays at
          housewares shop Çiçek Işleri, and shearling-trimmed denim jackets and
          rose-tinted sunglasses at Baston Vintage.
        </p>
        <p>
          With even an ounce of energy remaining, close out the night with a
          bucket of lemony, rice-stuffed mussels from the wildly popular
          Midyelerin Efendisi in Beşiktaş and a drink at the atmospheric Nardis
          Jazz Club in
          <a

            class="link"
            ><b><i>Cihangir</i></b></a
          >. The latter books a mix of local and international acts, like a
          quintet led by Ankara-born jazz vocalist and Fulbright scholar Ece
          Göksu.

        </h2>
        <p>
          While not as ornate as the Blue Mosque,
          <a
            href="/HTML Project/P01/img/suleymaniye.jpg"

          is just as impressive—and noticeably less touristy. It’s the
          second-largest imperial mosque in the city, built atop the third hill
          of Old Istanbul in the 16th century, by the great Ottoman architect
          Mimar Sinan at the behest of Suleiman the Magnificent. On a clear day,
          the views from the courtyard are unbeatable. Don’t miss the cemetery,
          either, where the carvings atop each tombstone indicate that person’s
          station in life (a fez headdress was reserved for government
          officials, a turban for someone of the religious order, an anchor for
          a seaman, and so on). For a late breakfast or early lunch, meander
          over to Mimar Sinan, one of several nearby restaurants specializing in
          kuru fasülye, white beans stewed in olive oil and tomato sauce and
          served with rice pilaf. It’s Turkey’s unofficial national dish, and
          especially popular with lira-pinching students.

          Now on to the world-famous<a

            target="_blank"
            class="link"
            ><b><i>Grand Bazaar</i></b></a
          >
          , one of the oldest and largest covered markets on earth. Twenty-two
          gates usher you into a labyrinth of 4,500 stores; you’ll definitely
          get lost, and that’s okay—it’s how you stumble upon happy mistakes
          like hammered-copper serving trays, hand-tooled leather bags, and
          glittering zultanite rings. Or you can go in with a game plan,
          knocking out a list of covetable souvenirs from established shops like
          Dervis (good for pastel-striped peştemals), Soy Türkiye (for
          professional-grade copper cookware), Iznik Art (for çini, a
          traditional Turkish pottery in bold turquoise and red tulip motifs),
          and Yazzma (ikat central). If it’s a hand-knotted silk rug you’re
          after, venture out of the bazaar and over to Orient Handmade Carpets,
          a spectacular showroom run by a fifth-generation Anatolian family.
          Here, more than 14,000 carpets are spread across 27 rooms. Be prepared
          to invest, as this level of quality does not come cheap.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more market to go, and that’s
          <a href="/HTML Project/P01/img/a5.jpg" target="_blank" class="link"
            ><b><i>Mısır Çarşısı</i></b></a
          >
          , a.k.a. the Egyptian Bazaar or Spice Market. It’s a wonderful place
          to photograph centuries-old architecture, rows of Turkish delight
          vendors, and pyramids of fragrant spices. Pick up potent vials of
          amber and rose oil at 72-year-old perfumery Istanbuli; and don’t
          forget to buy a bag of freshly ground Turkish coffee from Kurukahveci
          Mehmetv Efendi, one of the oldest coffee shops in Istanbul.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re not totally wiped out, it’s worth a spin through the
          antiques district of Çukurcuma in
          <a
            href="/HTML Project/P01/img/beyoglu.jpg"
            target="_blank"
            class="link"
            ><b><i>Beyoǧlu</i></b></a
          >. Here you’ll find quality dealers like A La Turca, although one of
          the most curious stores is The Works Objects of Desire (tagline: “For
          the slightly deranged collector seeking identifiable memories”). The
          cluttered bric-a-brac shop provides artifacts for the conceptual
          vignettes displayed in the nearby Museum of Innocence, based on the
          namesake novel by Nobel Prize–winning Turkish author Orhan Pamuk (who
          also happened to live in the house before it was converted into a
          museum). Fans of the book, as well as of Joseph Cornell–esque
          assemblages, will appreciate both the store and the museum. Don’t be
          surprised if you walk away with a 70-year-old dental mold or vintage
          police badge from the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          Final stop: Dinner at Çukurcuma Köftecisi, a mom-and-pop meatball shop
          with just six tables and enough tempting cold meze dishes that you may
          forget to leave room for the köfte.

          >Kuzguncuk, once settled by Jews, then Greek-Orthodox and Armenian
          Christians, and now Muslims. You’ll sample menemen (lightly set eggs
          scrambled with salty feta, tomato, chilis, and a bucket of olive oil)
          at Çakmak Kahvaltı Salonu; tavuk göğsü (savory milk pudding made with
          chicken skin) at Murat Muhallebicisi; pickled everything at Üsküdarlı
          Ünal Turşuları, and a real grandma’s made-from-scratch manti (tiny
          dumplings served in a pool of chili butter) at the family-run Hatice
          Anne Ev Yemekleri.

          There are opportunities to buy chestnut honey, fresh figs as big as a
          toddler’s fist, and boxes of rainbow-colored Turkish delight. You’ll
          eat yourself silly, but you’ll also tour churches and mosques, swing
          through a seafood market where the stands are manned by bearded
          fishermen in galoshes, visit a cat-mobbed cemetery where whirling
          dervishes are buried, and meet Istanbul’s last great umbrella
          repairman (he’s a hoot!). The tour lasts anywhere from six to nine
          hours, depending on your group’s endurance level, and covers well over
          a dozen eateries. (If he’s available, ask for Benoit to be your guide;
          you won’t be disappointed.) The day out is a feast for the eyes and
          stomach, and you’ll be positively stuffed by nightfall. It’s the most
          satisfying way to end an all-too-short adventure in one of the world’s
          most fascinating and diverse cities.
